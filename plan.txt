Two Bugs that needs to be fixed


bug 1 : dropzone can contain more than one puzzle piece.

Should : only contain 1 puzzle piece at a time.

fix : Need to limit the lenght  of the children to "0" possibly in the function
allowdrop(event) in order to solve this issue.




Bug 2 :drop zone puzzle pieces does not reset after changing to
       another puzzle game board.

Should : reset after picking another puzzle game baord.

Fix : In order to fix this , we need to create a function that will reset the puzzle pieces
and bring them back to their original place;firstChild & removeChild could be used as well to 
solve this issue.
